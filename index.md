My name is Marc Gillioz, and I am [a theoretical physicist working on quantum field theory](about.html). Besides my academic activities, I am also an AI enthusiast. This blog describes a project that I have started after attending the [*fast.ai*](https://www.fast.ai/) online course.

The goal is to use **deep learning** to explore the dynamics of a simple paper-and-paper game called *Morpion Solitaire*.

My approach is presented in a series of blog posts:

1. [**The game**](2021/11/29/Part_1_Game.html): What is the game about? Why is this an interesting framework for deep learning?
2. [**The data**](2022/01/05/Part_2_Data.html): What is the data used for deep learning? How is it organized?
3. [**A simple binary problem**](/2022/01/07/Part_3_Binary_problem.html): Answering a yes/no question with a basic model.
4. ...

This is on-going work, so stay tuned for updates (subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml)).
