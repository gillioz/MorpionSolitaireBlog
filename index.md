My name is Marc Gillioz, and I am [a theoretical physicist working on quantum field theory](about.html). Besides my academic activities, I am also an AI enthusiast. This blog describes a project that I have started after attending the [*fast.ai*](https://www.fast.ai/) online course.

The goal is to use deep learning to explore the dynamics of a simple paper-and-paper game called *Morpion Solitaire*. My modest results are presented in a series of blog posts:

1. [**The game**](2021/11/29/Part_1_Game.html): What is the game about? Why is this an interesting framework for deep learning?
1. [**The data**](2022/01/05/Part_2_Data.html): What is the data used for deep learning? How is it organized?
1. **A simple binary problem** (upcoming): Answering a yes/no question with a basic model.
1. ...

I hope that you will have as much fun reading about the project as I had putting it together!
