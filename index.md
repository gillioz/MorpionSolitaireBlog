This is the blog for a project that I have started after attending the [*fast.ai*](https://www.fast.ai/) online course. 

The goal is to use **deep learning** to explore the dynamics of a simple paper-and-paper game called *Morpion Solitaire*.

My approach is presented in a series of blog posts:

1. [**The game**]({{ site.baseurl }}/2021/11/29/Part_1_Game.html): What is the game about? Why is this an interesting framework for deep learning?
2. [**The data**]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/01/05/Part_2_Data.html): What is the data used for deep learning? How is it organized?
3. [**A simple binary problem**]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/01/07/Part_3_Binary_problem.html): Answering a yes/no question with a basic model.
4. [**Going deeper with a counting problem**]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/01/28/Part_4_Counting.html): Solving a more complicated problem with a deeper network.
5. [**Playing with a model**]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/02/04/Part_5_Playing_model.html): How do we use the model to improve our exploration of the game.
6. **My first ResNet** (coming up): Starting to make real predictions with a residual network.
7. ...

This is on-going work, so stay tuned for updates!
