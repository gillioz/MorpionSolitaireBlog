Hi! My name is Marc Gillioz.

I am a theoretical physicist, specialized in [conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory).
Besides my academic activities (see [my publications at arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/a/gillioz_m_1.html)), I am also a deep learning enthusiast.

This blog describes a project that I have started in my free time after attending the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) online course.
I hope that you will have as much fun reading about it as I had putting it together.
