# About

I am a theoretical physicist working in [conformal field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory), a special case of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) with [scale invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance) in which we have a decent (and growing) understanding of the strong-coupling regime. A list of my publications can be found on [the arXiv preprint server](https://arxiv.org/a/gillioz_m_1.html).

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/) in Trieste, Italy.
Before that I have been doing research at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lptp/) (Lausanne, Switzerland), at [UC Davis](https://qmap.ucdavis.edu/) (USA), and at the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.cp3-origins.dk). I am originally from [Sion](https://goo.gl/maps/2KSLcLG25jX94kfU9), a nice little town in the Swiss alps.
