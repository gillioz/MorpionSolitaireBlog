# About

I am currently a postdoctoral research in the [theoretical particle physics group](https://www.sissa.it/tpp/) at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/) in Trieste, Italy.
Before that I have been doing research at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lptp/) (Lausanne, Switzerland), at [UC Davis](https://qmap.ucdavis.edu/) (USA), and at the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.cp3-origins.dk). I am originally from [Sion](https://goo.gl/maps/2KSLcLG25jX94kfU9), a nice little town in the Swiss alps.
